					<p><h4>We heard many people say that it is impossible to find a plumber / electrician / carpenter or any person who is reliable and can do a quality job. This set us thinking why the current search directories don't work. The reasons were many: They were paid listings. Reviews were fake / not reliable. And once we leave our contact number with search directories, we would get a plethora of calls making my life hell. Moreover, we still don't have a clue of which service provider to engage with as there is no guarantee of quality of work, fair pricing and the provider coming on time to do the job. This set us thinking, why this process has to be so painful. Why cant we buy local services the way we buy products from ecommerce sites on the click of a button.</p>
